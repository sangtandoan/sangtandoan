I'm a dedicated back-end developer with a strong passion for Go. After learning and coding with various languages, I've found Go to be my favorite for its simplicity, efficiency, and powerful concurrency model. Whether it's building scalable microservices, working with APIs, or handling real-time data, Goâ€™s performance and clarity make it stand out from the rest.

I'm on the look out for a role in backend web development, ideally writing Go or JavaScript. If you're looking for someone who loves leveraging Goâ€™s simplicity and power to solve real-world problems, letâ€™s connect!
